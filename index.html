          <h3>Exploropedia</h3>
          <p> Exploropedia a web application which assists a person who is planning to visit or know about a
			city. It displays complete list of all the hotels in that city with information like ratings and reviews. The
			application also lists top tourist attractions and ‘things to do’ in the city with detailed description. It would
			give better results than many of the existing E-tourism websites for small or not-so-popular cities e.g.
			Amethi. </p>

          <h3>Tourist Navigation System</h3>
          <p>It is a web based application intended for tourists. A tourist, who is visiting a new city, can have
			many requirements such as sight-seeing, shopping, having some specific food etc. The application
			suggests the user shortest itinerary fulfilling all these requirements. Thus the tourist saves her time and
			effort by travelling on the shortest path.</p>

          <h4> Work </h4>
          <p> Currently, I am working as an intern in Sapient Razorfish, Bangalore. I work mostly on Web Developement and front-end
          technologies. Interns are given production demanding projects which affect the companies performance. People at Sapient are always ready to help you out whenever you need them. You can come and go whenever you want. You won't be questioned why you were late, but rather you'll be questioned how your work is going. I'm really glad I could intern at Sapient. </p>
